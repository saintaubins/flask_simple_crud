first we will be creating the environment for our app.

pip install pipenv this is already install for me at the time.

pipenv shell

next we will be installing flask and Flask-SQlalchemy

pipenv install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy.

*****************************************************************************

after setting up the environment, we will be setting up the database and creating a static folder, and templates folder.

we will be using bootstrap CDN and need to import some files.

see that the file structure is correct before moving forward.

see the boilerplate code for the 4 files.


******************************************************************************

this will not run yet, we have to do a few things.

1. create the tables in the database.

to get into postgres shell type psql postgres, then \l to see a list of all  the tables.
type \q anythime to quit.

2. if getting too lazy launch pgadmin, and password is sem123

back to commandline.

3. to create a db type "CREATE DATABASE test;" don't forget the semi colon

to connect to the database \c db name, in this case test.

4. then we have to create the tables with the constraints.
